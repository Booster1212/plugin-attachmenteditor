# Athena Object Editor

Simple Attachment Editor which allows you to have an Athena-based solution to attach props correctly to your character.

## Description

The plugin will generate a .json file if you are using the filesystem or either log to console if you switch the boolean state in the config.

## Install as a submodule

In your current directionary (altv-athena) do cd /src/core/plugins

git submodule add https://github.com/Booster1212/plugin-attachmenteditor

## Install as a non-submodule

Clone the folder and drag and drop it into src/core/plugins.

Submodules will allow you to directly pull changes out of the upstream.
